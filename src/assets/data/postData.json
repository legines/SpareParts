        "contentOne": "Did you hear the news? Breaking news? Shocking news? There's a new addition to the Spare Parts family: a new Z. I used to own a 2008 350z for 12 years and enjoyed every second with that car. Totally didn't expect to get one yet, but I don't know...I walked into the dealership to browse and the next thing I know I was signing the paperwork and picking the car up the next day. I keep trying to compate the new Z to my old 350z and expect it to behave similarly, but they are like night and day. Anyways, the car came with a front lip from Nissan that I may install in the future, although it will probably get scraped up pretty badly once the car is on coilovers. It all depends on what the other front lip options are out there for the car.",
        "contentOneExample": "",
        "contentTwo": "I bought a Z1 oil catch can the day I signed the paperwork for the car and installed it over the weekend. Blow-by is when pressure leaks past the piston rings and into the crankcase (basically the empty space in an engine) when the car is running. In turbo charged cars you have a lot more pressure being created = higher levels of blow-by = higher levels of oil / contaminants getting into the intake system. In theory these catch cans are supposed to collect oil vapor / contaminants before they reach the engine's intake manifold so there isn't a build up of carbon on the intake valves. The catch can will collect the contaminants at the bottom and the clean air is passed back into the intake system.",
        "contentThree": "I had the big brain idea to not follow the instructions when they said to take off the driver side intercooler for more room and instead installed everything with as little room as possible. As long as your hand can fit in a space it's all good right? :/ Removing the hoses and putting in the new ones was easy, it was putting the freaking hose clamps back on that was the issue. What a pain in the ass it was to put those clamps on. After adding lube to the hose and around the clamp and using needle nose pliers I was able to finish in about 5 minutes..I don't know why I always choose to do things the hard way. Why do this to myself? There's back and forth on the internet on the effectiveness of a catch can and if it actually does anything. I guess I'll find out after the first oil change. Anyways, the catch can is looking sweet and the car is too.",

        "postTitle": "Calculating wheel offsets in general & after changing lip / barrel size",
        "contentOne": "I like running lower offset wheels. Offset is the measurement of the distance between the wheels mounting surface and the centerline of the wheel. More negative = wheel sticks out more from the fender = more cool (to a degree). You could potentially run into break clearance issues depending on the offset of your wheels, which can be fixed by running some wheel spacers or by doing more reasearch on what offsets are 'ideal' to your needs. The first method uses a ruler and another straight edge to calculate the wheels offset. This video from Driftworks in the link below will explain how to do that, and it's exactly what I did.",
        "contentOneExample": "Although I already know the offset of my wheels, I wanted to try out the method myself. The wheel in the pictures below is a very dirty Work Equip 05 18 x 11 -4. The FIRST picture gives the measurement from the floor which is 302mm and taking half of that to find the centerline of the wheel gives 151mm. The SECOND picture is the measurement from the hub face, which is 155mm. So 151mm - 155mm = -4mm. The offset is -4mm. The THIRD picture is the measurement from the floor to the hub face, which is 155mm. So, 151mm - 155mm = -4mm. The offset is -4mm.",
        "contentTwo": "The second method involves resizing your wheels by changing the lip and barrel sizes, if your wheels are multi piece wheels. This will cause positive and negative changes to the offset depending on whether the lip or barrel was resized and by how much. The table below is what I have used to calculate new offsets in the past. Here you can see the change in wheel offset for every inch or half inch change in lip and barrel size.",
        "contentThree": "As an example, 18 x 11 -4  with a 4 inch lip and a 7 inch barrel  ===>  18 x 9.5 2.35 with a 3 inch lip and a 6.5 inch barrel. The lip was shortened by 1 inch, bringing the offset from -4 to 8.7 ( -4 + 12.7 ), and the barrel was shortened by 0.5 inches, bringing the final offset to 2.35 ( 8.7 - 6.35 ).",
        "contentFour": "Another example, 18 x 11 -4  with a 4 inch lip and a 7 inch barrel  ===>  18 x 9.5 12.05 with a 2.5 inch lip and a 7 inch barrel. The lip was shortened by 1.5 inches, bringing the offset from -4 to 15.05 ( -4 + 12.7 + 6.35).",
